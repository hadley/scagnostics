# pyscagnostics

Python wrapper for computing graph theoretic scatterplot diagnostics. 

"Scagnostics describe various measures of interest for pairs of variables, based on their appearance on a scatterplot.  They are useful tool for discovering interesting or unusual scatterplots from a scatterplot matrix, without having to look at every individual plot."
